Hello and welcome to my blog! I am Alex Little, a postdoctoral research associate in the [probability group](https://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/recherche/equipe-de-probabilites) at ENS de Lyon supervised by [Alice Guionnet](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/aguionne/) and [Karol Kozlowski](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/karol.kozlowski/home.php). My main interests are in random matrix theory, statistical mechanics, Riemann-Hilbert problems and integrable systems. My email is alexander.little@ens-lyon.fr.

My publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-JKoe_EAAAAJ&hl=en) and on arXiv. This blog is used to write about things I find interesting and to give accessible discussions of ideas from papers. To comment on an article please reply to the link posted [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alittlemaths).

My thesis, "Random Elements of Compact Lie Groups and Their Truncations," can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZEk9afNt6LvI1gzH1i11Sj4JmJyn9uc/view?usp=sharing) and my CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1akC_yZh_tX8ij0QsN8eBiPl0Aru8LELj/view?usp=sharing).
