Hello and welcome to my blog! I am Alex Little, a postdoctoral research associate in the [mathematical physics group](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/mathematical-physics/) at the University of Bristol supervised by [Thomas Bothner](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasbothner/home). My main interests are in random matrix theory, statistical mechanics, Riemann-Hilbert problems and integrable systems.

My publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-JKoe_EAAAAJ&hl=en) and on arXiv. This blog is used to write about things I find interesting and to give accessible discussions of ideas from papers. To comment on an article please reply to the link posted on Twitter.

My thesis, "Random Elements of Compact Lie Groups and Their Truncations," can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PZEk9afNt6LvI1gzH1i11Sj4JmJyn9uc/view?usp=sharing). My thesis advisor was [Francesco Mezzadri](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Francesco-Mezzadri-66ca5240-8f45-4ffc-a838-d1f68827bd23/).
